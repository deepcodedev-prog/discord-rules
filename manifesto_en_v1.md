## Article III: Discussion Guidelines *(Not Rules)*

### Section A: Roasting & Banter

Mutual roasting and banter between willing participants is allowed, but with important limits:

**§3.1 Proportionality** — If you roast someone, you can be roasted back at a similar level of intensity. Escalating from light jokes to severe attacks is not acceptable. Personal insults that attack someone's character, family, or private life go beyond playful roasting and are prohibited.

**§3.2 No Pile-Ons** — Multiple people ganging up on one person is bullying, even if that person roasted someone first. Exception: Brief, lighthearted group teasing is acceptable if it's short-lived and stops when asked.

**§3.3 Respect the "Time Out"** — If someone says they want to stop or disengage, continuing is harassment. Either party can end the exchange at any time. However, if you initiate roasting, the other person has the right to respond proportionally before you can call "time out."

**§3.4 Respect Non-Participants** — If someone explicitly states they don't participate in roasting or prefer not to be involved in banter, respect their boundary. This is different from a mid-exchange "time out" - it's a general preference that should be honored by all members. However, if someone claims this opt-out status but then initiates roasting others, they waive their immunity and can be roasted back.

**§3.5 Context Matters** — Roasting someone once doesn't give others unlimited license to harass them forever. Using roasting as cover for genuine harassment is prohibited and will be treated as a violation of Article II.

---

### Section B: Channel Etiquette

**§3.6 No Gatekeeping** — You cannot demand someone leave a public channel, kick them, or exclude them simply because you don't want them there. Public channels are open to all members.

**§3.7 Respect Private Conversations** — If a channel or voice chat is marked as "private" or "personal discussion," ask for permission before joining the conversation. This respects boundaries while maintaining community openness.

**§3.8 Voice Channel Inclusivity** — In voice channels with multiple participants, avoid extended one-on-one conversations that exclude others. When possible, move private discussions to a separate voice channel to keep the main space inclusive.

**§3.9 Respect Ongoing Activities** — If a channel is being used for a coordinated activity (gaming session, movie watch party, group discussion), avoid disrupting it with off-topic messages. Either participate or use another channel temporarily.

**§3.10 Activity-Specific Channels** — Consider using voice channels, threads, or designated channels for organized activities to avoid conflicts.

## Article IV: Important Notes

**§4.1 Discord TOS Compliance** — While this server prioritizes free speech, we must comply with [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines). Violations may result in reports to Discord Trust & Safety.

**§4.2 Private Platform Distinction** — Discord is a private platform - the First Amendment applies to government censorship, not private communities. These rules reflect our moderation philosophy, not legal obligations.

**§4.3 Voting Rights: Green Card System** — Only members with the "Green Card" role may vote in community polls and serve as jurors in server courts. The Green Card is obtained by:
- (a) **Automatic Grant:** Any member who has been in the server for 60+ days and enters their third month of membership (day 61 onwards) automatically qualifies for Green Card status upon moderator review
- (b) **Community Nomination:** If 25% or more of current Green Card holders vote to grant Green Card status to a member (regardless of join date), that member receives it. This recognizes exceptional contribution and integration into server culture
- (c) **Veteran Exception (Time-Limited):** During the first 6 months after server creation only, moderators may grant Green Card status to ancient/veteran members returning from previous communities. After this period, all Green Cards must be earned through methods (a) or (b)
- (d) **Transparency & Review Period:** All successful Green Card grants must be announced publicly in #announcements with method used (automatic/nominated/veteran) and basic reasoning. The community has 48 hours to raise concerns before the grant is finalized. If major concerns are raised (repeated Article II infractions or escalations from Article III to Article II violations), admins will review and may deny the grant. Failed nomination votes are not announced publicly to prevent embarrassment - only successful grants are announced.
- (e) **Revocation:** Green Card status can be revoked for extended inactivity (90+ days) or Tier 3+ violations. It can be re-earned after rehabilitation
- (f) **Non-Voting Participation:** Members without Green Cards may still participate in court proceedings as witnesses and provide input in discussion threads before polls
- (g) **Veteran Criteria:** Veteran Green Cards (method c) require documented proof of prior membership OR testimony from 25% of current Green Card holders who can attest to their veteran status. All veteran grants require admin approval with public justification to prevent favoritism
- (h) **Minimum Nomination Threshold:** Community nominations (method b) require a minimum of 5 Green Card holder votes regardless of percentage, to ensure meaningful community support at all server sizes
- (i) This system prevents vote manipulation by new or alternate accounts and ensures voters understand server culture

**§4.4 Community Determination** — When determining if behavior has crossed from banter into bullying, a community poll will be conducted among Green Card holders. The server community votes on whether the behavior is acceptable or has crossed the line. When in doubt, respect boundaries.

---

## Article V: Enforcement & Punishments

### Section A: Enforcement Methods

**§5.1 Enforcement Methods** — Violations will be handled based on community consensus for gray-area cases:
- (a) **Community Polls:** Quick votes among Green Card holders to determine if behavior crosses the line from banter to bullying/harassment
- (b) **Server Court:** For more serious or contested cases, a formal court may be held where both parties present their case and Green Card holders serve as jury (non-biased)
- (c) **Immediate Action:** Clear violations (illegal content, threats, CSAM, etc.) will result in immediate action without polls or court proceedings

### Section C: Moderator Structure

**§5.7 Moderator Hierarchy** — For transparency and efficiency:
- (a) **Admins** handle Tier 4 violations, appeals, automatic Green Card grants (§4.3a), and veteran Green Card approvals (§4.3c)
- (b) **Moderators** handle Tier 1-3 violations, facilitate community votes, and process community-nominated Green Cards (§4.3b)
- (c) All Tier 3+ actions must be logged in a moderator-visible channel
- (d) Moderator actions can be appealed within 48 hours per §5.13

**§5.8 Emergency Moderation** — In cases of active raids, mass spam, or ongoing severe violations, moderators may take immediate action including:
- (a) Temporary server lockdown or slowmode
- (b) Mass mutes/bans without individual review
- (c) Community votes will be conducted after resolution to validate actions
- (d) Emergency actions must be reported to admins within 24 hours

### Section D: Additional Enforcement Rules

**§5.9 No Abuse of Enforcement Mechanisms** — Falsely reporting others, manipulating polls, or using enforcement tools as retaliation is prohibited and may result in harsher penalties than the original offense.

**§5.10 No Abuse of Power** — Leveraging administrator or moderator rights for personal gain, retaliation, or unfair advantage is prohibited.

**§5.11 Moderators Are Not Exempt** — Moderators and server staff are subject to all rules. If a moderator violates rules, they can be reported and face the same enforcement process, including community polls and server courts conducted by Green Card holders.

**§5.12 Private Reporting** — If you're uncomfortable addressing unwanted advances or harassment publicly, use the dedicated #reports channel (visible only to moderators) or DM a moderator directly.

**§5.13 Appeals Process** — Any member may appeal a punishment by:
- (a) Submitting a written appeal to moderators via DM or #reports channel
- (b) Requesting a server court hearing if the punishment was Tier 3 or higher
- (c) Waiting 7 days before appealing temporary punishments, 6 months for permanent bans
- (d) Providing evidence or context that wasn't considered in the original decision
- (e) Appeals for Tier 4 violations require admin review

**§5.14 Rehabilitation & Record Clearing** — Members with a clean record for 90 consecutive days will have their previous Tier 1 and Tier 2 violations removed from consideration for escalation purposes. Record clearing may be granted at most twice per member lifetime. After the second clearing, no further clearing is possible and the escalation clock never resets again; subsequent violations will always count toward escalation.
